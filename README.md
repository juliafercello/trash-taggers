# TrashTaggers
Organize a trash pickup event in this Eco-Friendly App.

# Project Overview
Trash Taggers is a green app that allows users to organize and/or signup for trash pickup events in their local community. 

The home page shows the five upcoming events along with the ability to signup.  Users are also able to create new events or view all future events. 

When a user chooses to create an event or join an event, they are prompted to login with Google.  From there, the user is able to complete their task and help keep our cities clean!

This project utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap, Google Authentication, Google Maps, Passport JS, Moment and Sequelize.
